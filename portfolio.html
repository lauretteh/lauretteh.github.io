My main interests are Statistical Analysis, Statistical Learning, Spatial Statistics as applied to Atmospherics, the Mathematics of Political Redistricting, Ethics in STEM, and Psychometrics specifically to improve the human experience.  My hobbies include History of Mathematics, Old World Navigation, Sundials from around the World, and using Computers for what they were originally meant for - Computing.</p>

<p>Although I work in large number of platforms, I prefer to focus on Python, C++, and Fortran for High Performance Computing and R for Sttistical Programming.  My time in Software Build & Release focused on high-risk products requiring a high level of development control.  This included medical software and networking products.  Typically, I worked in shops ranging from 50-250 software engineers with quarterly releases.  My recent work has focused on Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, and Supercomputing.</p>

<header><a href="bus_intel.html"><h4>Business Intelligence</h4></a></header>
<p>My strengths are SQL-based Extract, Transfor, and Load (ETL) using AWS E2 and Azure and Machine Learning-based Predictive Analytics or Statistical Analytics such as Market Basket Analysis or Neural Networks.  I chose to learn Machine Learning from the Business perspective because of the fast, savvy payload techniques involved.  I enjoyed a number of cloud computing platforms, such as Azure and AWS E2, but also the statistical platforms, such as SAS and R.</p>

<header><a href="data_sys.html"><h4>Data Systems</h4></a></header>
<p>I work with both structured data systems (traditional database architecture) and unstructured data (big data, streaming data, scraped and time-based).  I believe there are a number of advantages to working with structured databases before moving to large data techniques, even though the two are completely different.  Structured databases are one of the best-designed tools on the planet, with redundant and sound logic.  How else could you withdraw $100 from an ATM and have it instantly and securely reconcile with your bank 10 databases away?  Large data, especially weather data, fascinates me endlessly, though.  Multi-dimensional data systems are where I would mainly like to focus in the future.  </p>
